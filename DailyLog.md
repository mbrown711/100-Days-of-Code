# Daily Log for 100 Days of Code

## 4/24/19

- Started the 100 days of code challenge.
- Started out with Python and using Learn Python 3 the Hard Way. It's OK - just a bunch of different exercises. Might try something else.

## 4/25/19

- Decided to switch to Python Crash Course - a MUCH better book.
- I'll still keep LP3THW, but just for practicing exercises.

## 4/26/19

- Didn't have any commits, however, I did still have to code for DBMS class. Just can't post the code publicly (and no - I'm not just saying this so I can keep the challenge going).

## 4/27/19

- Going to really hit it hard with Python Crash Course and Linux Basics for Hacking. Not really sure how I'm going to show the code for LBFH, since it's mainly scripts and talking to the terminal, but I'm sure I'll figure it out.

## 4/28/19

- Did a lot of python practice
- continued to work on the friends database app from udemy

## 4/29/19

- Have an hour before class to code, python practice
