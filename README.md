# 100 Days of Code

Each day of the week will be one of the following books:
 
- Crash Course in Python (Python)
- Cracking the Coding Interview (Java)
- Linux Basics for Hackers
- Java Head First (Java)
- Various other books and resources (Automate the Boring Stuff, MOOCs, Udemy, etc.)
 
I’ll spend, at the very least, 1 hour/day coding from these books and resources. 

It’s essentially a rotation between keeping my Java sharp and learning Python/other languages and resources.

I'll also ***try*** to keep a daily log after each session.
